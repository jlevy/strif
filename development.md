## Development

[Fork](https://github.com/jlevy/kmd/fork) this repo (having your own fork will make it
easier to contribute),
[check out](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository),
and then install the package dependencies:

```shell
poetry install
```

Developer workflows:

```shell
# Run poetry install, lint, and test:
make

# Build wheel:
make build

# Linting and testing individually:
make lint
make test

# Delete all the build artifacts:
make clean

# To run a shell within the Python environment:
poetry shell
# Thereafter you can run tests.

# To run tests:
pytest   # all tests
pytest -s src/module/some_file.py  # one test, showing outputs

# Poetry dependency management commands:
# Upgrade all dependencies:
poetry up
# Update poetry itself: 
poetry self update
```

## Release Process

This project is set up to publish to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) from GitHub Actions.

Thanks to [the dynamic versioning
plugin](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) and `publish.yml`
workflow, you can simply create tagged releases (using standard format for the tag name,
e.g. `v0.1.0`) on GitHub and the tag will trigger a release build, which then uploads it
to PyPI.

For this to work you will need to have a PyPI account and authorize your repository to
publish to PyPI. The simplest way to do that is on [the publishing settings
page](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/). Configure "Trusted Publisher
Management" and register your GitHub repo as a new "pending" trusted publisher, entering
the project name, repo owner, repo name, and `publish.yml` as the workflow name.
